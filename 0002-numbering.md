# Numbering

This guidance provides a mechanism to index and have a single source of truth, as well as iterate on them
collaboratively and transparently. This document describes the guidance numbering system which is based on
[Google's API Numbering](https://google.aip.dev/2).

## Assigning AIP Numbers

The Clarity team is responsible for assigning guidance numbers. The team may decide to reserve a specific of numbers for
grouping guidance. Beyond this, numbers are assigned arbitrarily. In general, the team will simply use the next
available number.

## Number Blocks

Currently recognized blocks of guidance numbers are:

- *1-99*: reserved for meta-guidance (generally process-related)
- *100-999*: single component guidance
